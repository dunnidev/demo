/**
 * swCache.ts
 *
 * Explicit cache versioning and migration for the Wraith service worker.
 *
 * Every cache the app owns is named `wraith-<kind>-v<CACHE_VERSION>`. Because the
 * version is part of the name, a schema change is a rename rather than an
 * in-place mutation: the new worker writes to fresh caches and the activation
 * handler deletes everything else it owns.
 *
 * Rules enforced here:
 * - Any cache prefixed with `wraith-` that is not in `expectedCacheNames()` is
 *   obsolete, whichever version produced it (so both forward updates and
 *   roll-backs converge on the running version).
 * - Caches created before this convention existed (`LEGACY_CACHE_NAMES` /
 *   `LEGACY_CACHE_PREFIXES`) are treated as obsolete so existing installs
 *   migrate on their next activation.
 * - Anything the app does not own is left alone. Never delete another app's
 *   caches on the same origin.
 *
 * Bump `CACHE_VERSION` whenever the precache/runtime cache *schema* changes —
 * i.e. when the set, meaning, or shape of cached responses changes, not for
 * ordinary asset revisions (Workbox already revisions precache entries
 * individually).
 *
 * This module is imported from the service worker bundle, so it must stay free
 * of browser/DOM and React dependencies.
